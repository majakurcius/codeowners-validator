## Prerequisites

* [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.15 or higher
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Make

Helper scripts may introduce additional dependencies. However, all helper scripts support the `INSTALL_DEPS` environment variable flag.
By default, this flag is set to `false`. This way, the scripts will try to use the tools installed on your local machine. This helps speed up the development process.
If you do not want to install any additional tools, or you want to ensure reproducible script 
results, export `INSTALL_DEPS=true`. This way, the proper tool version will be automatically installed and used.

2. Clone the repository locally. 
    > **TIP:** This project uses Go modules, so you can check it out locally wherever you want. It doesn't need to be checked out in `$GOPATH`.
3. Set the `codeowners-validator` repository as upstream:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream git@github.com:mszostok/codeowners-validator.git
    ```

### Integration tests

This project supports the integration tests that are defined in the [test](./test) package. The tests are executed against [`gh-codeowners/codeowners-samples`](https://github.com/gh-codeowners/codeowners-samples).

> **CAUTION:** Currently, running the integration tests both on external PRs and locally by external contributors is not supported, as the teams used for testing are visible only to the organization members. 
> At the moment, the `codeowners-validator` repository owner is responsible for running these tests. 

## Build a binary

To generate a binary for this project, execute:
```bash
make build
```

This command generates a binary named `codeowners-validator` in the root directory.
